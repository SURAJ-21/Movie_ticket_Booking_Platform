This is a comprehensive operating system mini-project centered around a movie ticket booking platform. The system consists of a main server and an admin component, which functions as a client for the main server and concurrently serves as a server for client processes. Key features include robust login and signup facilities, enabling secure user authentication.

In addition to ticket booking functionality, the project incorporates features such as movie addition and deletion. The admin component plays a crucial role in decision-making processes, providing a centralized hub for managing various aspects of the platform. All these components are seamlessly integrated, creating a cohesive system that addresses a range of functionalities, from user authentication to dynamic pricing and interactive payment systems, making it a versatile and complete project.
